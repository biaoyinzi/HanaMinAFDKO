## VS.

### Hanazono Mincho (original version)

Original [Hanazono Mincho](https://fonts.jp/) is generated by
[FontForge](http://fontforge.org/), and is TrueType-based. On the
other hand, this font is created by
[AFDKO](http://www.adobe.com/devnet/opentype/afdko.html), and is
CFF-based.

## Supported Systems

Included fonts have been confirmed to work properly with Windows,
Macintosh and Linux.

However, these two fonts have identical family name "Hanazono Mincho"
for both "HanaMinA" and "HanaMinB" fonts (sub-family names are "A" and
"B" respectively), so the software that can not handle multiple fonts
with the same font family name may not work properly.

## Install

Pre-built fonts can be download from [releases page](http://github.com/cjkvi/HanaMinAFDKO/releases).

To build the fonts, you need to install AFDKO and put their command
directory to $PATH. Suppose $AFDKO is
"/FDK/Tools/SharedData/FDKScripts" directory, run the following
commands to create the fonts. (Please keep in mind that it may take
long time to build the fonts.)

    mergeFonts -cid HanaMinA.cidinfo HanaMinA.raw HanaMinA.cidmap HanaMinA.pfa
    perl $AFDKO/hintcidfont.pl hintparam.txt < HanaMinA.raw > HanaMinA.hinted.raw
    autohint -r -q HanaMinA.hinted.raw
    makeotf -newNameID4 -mf HanaMinA.fmndb -cs 1 -ci HanaMinA.ivs -ch HanaMinA.cmap \
        -f HanaMinA.hinted.raw -ff HanaMinA.features -o HanaMinA.otf

    mergeFonts -cid HanaMinB.cidinfo HanaMinB.raw HanaMinB.cidmap HanaMinB.pfa
    perl $AFDKO/hintcidfont.pl hintparam.txt < HanaMinB.raw > HanaMinB.hinted.raw
